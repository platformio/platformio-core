Continuous Integration
======================

`Continuous Integration (CI, wiki) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_
is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working
copies with a shared mainline several times a day.

:ref:`cmd_ci` command is intended to be used in combination with the build
servers and the popular
`Continuous Integration Software <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software>`_.

By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more
easily.
